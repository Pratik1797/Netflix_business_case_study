# Netflix Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of the **Netflix dataset** sourced from **Kaggle**, focused on providing **business insights** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset includes detailed information about the content available on Netflix, such as movie/show titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more.

Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, I performed an in-depth analysis to uncover meaningful trends and patterns, which were then visualized using a variety of graphs including **line graphs**, **bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **heatmaps**.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed detailed exploration of Netflix content, user demographics, and viewing behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations using line graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts to help identify patterns and trends in the data.
- **Business Insights**: Generated actionable business insights related to content performance, genre popularity, regional preferences, and more.

## Project Workflow
1. **Load Data**: Load the Netflix dataset and perform initial checks.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use **Pandas** for data exploration and **Numpy** for statistical analysis.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
5. **Business Insights**: Derive actionable insights based on the patterns and trends observed.

## Visualizations
The following types of visualizations were created during the analysis:
- **Line Graphs**: To track trends over time, such as the growth in Netflix's content library.
- **Bar Charts**: To compare different genres, countries, or content types.
- **Heatmaps**: To analyze correlation between various attributes such as release years, ratings, and content types.
- **Pie Charts**: To display the proportion of different categories, such as content type (movie vs. TV show) or genre distribution.

## Insights for Stakeholders
- Key trends related to **content distribution** across different genres and countries.
- **User preferences** and viewing behavior based on demographic data.
- **Growth trends** in Netflixâ€™s catalog and insights into popular content types.
